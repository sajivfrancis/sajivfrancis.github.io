Products and apps built on top of the Jira platform help teams plan, assign, track, report, and manage work. The Jira platform brings teams together for everything from agile software development and customer support to start-ups and enterprises (or to weddings and home renovations.)

The products built on the Jira platform are Jira Software, Jira Service Management, and Jira Core. Jira Align is an enterprise agile planning platform that connects work at scale.

Jira Software, Jira Service Management, and Jira Core come with built-in project templates for different use cases, and integrate seamlessly, so teams across organizations can work better and smarter together.
