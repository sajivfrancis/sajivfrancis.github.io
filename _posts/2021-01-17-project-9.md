## SAP FIORI
Fiori refers to the User Experience (UX) design language created by SAP and adopted in their current and all future software products. (e.g. the Fiori Launchpad in S/4 HANA, the Fiori application library, the SAP
HANA Cockpit for XSA etc). The Fiori UX has also been extended to be included in mobile platforms such as IOS and Android for native devices.

## Development of Custom FIORI Application:

SAP Fiori applications are built on top of the SAPUI5 JavaScript library, the SAPUI5 JS library is a set of HTML5 controls, CSS3 styles and javascript built by SAP for the purpose of creating Fiori applications. SAP customers with a paid license can have access to and create these SAPUI5 / Fiori applications. For non SAP entities/individuals who would like to build SAP like Fiori applications using UI5, there is an open source version
called OpenUI5.

## Comparison between SAPUI5 and OpenSAPUI5
